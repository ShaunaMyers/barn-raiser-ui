## Overview and Project Goals
Welcome to BarnRaiser - where your community can come together to ask for help and offer up help! This application makes it possible for individual community members to post a request via our form, to ask for help with a particular need. User looking to help others can then view a list of needs and can sign up for needs.

The goal of this Mod 4 Capstone [project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/) was to unite the backend and front end cohorts. We completed this project in 2 1/2 weeks while challenging ourselves to learn new technologies. We focused on high-level planning and cross-communication between the backend and frontend group members while building out a completely functional application.

## Installation and Viewing 

Our application is deployed to Heroku. You may view the live application [here](https://barn-raiser.herokuapp.com/)

Our Backend Repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Barn-Raiser/Barn-Raiser-BE)

To view our application on your local device:

- Clone down this repository
- Run `npm i` in your terminal
- Run `npm start` in your terminal
- To view Cypress tests open a separate tab in your terminal and run `npm run cypress`
- You do not need to clone our API as it is already deployed to Heroku

### Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- The ability to independently learn a new technology
- Querying and mutating data with GraphQL syntax via ApolloClient
- Building a frontend using React to display data
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
