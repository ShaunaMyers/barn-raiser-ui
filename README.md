## Overview and Project Goals
Welcome to BarnRaiser - where your community can come together to ask for help and offer up help! This application makes it possible for individual community members to post requests asking for help, via our form. Users looking to help others can then view a list of needs and can sign up for needs.

The goal of this Mod 4 Capstone [project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/) was to unite the backend and front end cohorts. We completed this project in 2 1/2 weeks while challenging ourselves to learn new technologies. We focused on high-level planning and cross-communication between the backend and frontend group members while building out a completely functional application.

## Installation and Viewing 

Our application is deployed to Heroku. You may view the live application [here](https://barn-raiser.herokuapp.com/)

Our Backend Repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Barn-Raiser/Barn-Raiser-BE)

To view our application on your local device:

- Clone down this repository
- Run `npm i` in your terminal
- Run `npm start` in your terminal
- To view Cypress tests open a separate tab in your terminal and run `npm run cypress`
- You do not need to clone our API as it is already deployed to Heroku

### Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- The ability to independently learn a new technology
- Querying and mutating data with GraphQL syntax via ApolloClient
- Building a frontend using React to display data
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
